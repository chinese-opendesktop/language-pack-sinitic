"Portable Network Graphics format is an extensible file format for the "
"lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a "
"patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of "
"TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as "
"the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display "
"option. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color-"
