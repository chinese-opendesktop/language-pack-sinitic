msgid ""
"<h1>Browser Identification</h1><p>The browser-identification module allows "
"you to have full control over how KDE applications using the HTTP protocol "
"(like Konqueror) will identify itself to web sites you browse.</p><p>This "
"ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not "
"display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current "
"versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the "
"browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages "
"properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. "
"Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be "
"using non-standard web protocols and or specifications.</p><p><u>NOTE:</u> "
"To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply "
"click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the "
"section for which you are seeking help.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Cache</h1><p>This module lets you configure your cache settings.</"
"p><p>This specific cache is an area on the disk where recently read web "
"pages are stored. If you want to retrieve a web page again that you have "
"recently read, it will not be downloaded from the Internet, but rather "
"retrieved from the cache, which is a lot faster.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgid "<h1>Cookie Management Quick Help</h1>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Cookies</h1><p>Cookies contain information that KDE application using "
"the HTTP protocol (like Konqueror) stores on your computer from a remote "
"Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about "
"you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might "
"consider this an invasion of privacy.</p><p>However, cookies are useful in "
"certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so "
"you can 'put things into a shopping basket'. Some sites require you have a "
"browser that supports cookies.</p><p>Because most people want a compromise "
"between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability "
"to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set "
"KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or "
"simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept "
"all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to "
"do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with "
"the cookie dialog box, click on <i> This domain </i> under the 'apply to' "
"tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the <i> "
"Domain Specific Policy </i> tab and set it to accept. This enables you to "
"receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE "
"receives a cookie.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Cookies</h1><p>Cookies contain information that KDE applications using "
"the HTTP protocol (like Konqueror) store on your computer, initiated by a "
"remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information "
"about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You "
"might consider this an invasion of privacy.</p><p> However, cookies are "
"useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet "
"shops, so you can 'put things into a shopping basket'. Some sites require "
"you have a browser that supports cookies.</p><p> Because most people want a "
"compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, the HTTP kioslave "
"offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might "
"want to set the default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a "
"cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that "
"you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access "
"the web sites without being prompted every time a cookie is received.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Enhanced Browsing</h1> In this module you can configure some enhanced "
"browsing features of KDE. <h2>Web Shortcuts</h2>Web Shortcuts are a quick "
"way of using Web search engines. For example, type \"duckduckgo:frobozz\" or "
"\"dd:frobozz\" and your web browser will do a search on DuckDuckGo for "
"\"frobozz\". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this "
"keyboard shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the Run Command dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Network Preferences</h1>Here you can define the behavior of KDE programs "
"when using Internet and network connections. If you experience timeouts or "
"use a modem to connect to the Internet, you might want to adjust these "
"settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Proxy</h1><p>A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between "
"your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching "
"and/or filtering.</p><p>Caching proxy servers give you faster access to "
"sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of "
"those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability "
"to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block.</"
"p><p><u>Note:</u> Some proxy servers provide both services.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<h1>Windows Shares</h1><p>Applications using the SMB kioslave (like "
"Konqueror) are able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if "
"properly configured.</p><p>You can specify here the credentials used to "
"access the shared resources. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled "
"so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you "
"may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as "
"such.</p>"
