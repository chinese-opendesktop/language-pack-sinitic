"<b>Security notice:</b>\n"
"                             According to a security audit by Taylor Hornby "
"(Defuse Security),\n"
"                             the current implementation of Encfs is "
"vulnerable or potentially vulnerable\n"
"                             to multiple types of attacks.\n"
"                             For example, an attacker with read/write "
"access\n"
"                             to encrypted data might lower the decryption "
"complexity\n"
"                             for subsequently encrypted data without this "
"being noticed by a legitimate user,\n"
"                             or might use timing analysis to deduce "
"information.\n"
"                             <br /><br />\n"
"                             This means that you should not synchronize\n"
"                             the encrypted data to a cloud storage service,\n"
"                             or use it in other circumstances where the "
"attacker\n"
"                             can frequently access the encrypted data.\n"
