"<p>During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration "
"(mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has "
"changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs "
"to be updated.</p><p>This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all "
"directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus "
"making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system "
"configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed "
"before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various "
"problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications "
"about missing required mimetypes, etc.).</p><p>Changes of system "
"configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore "
"recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing "
"applications.</p>"

"performance.</p>"

"<p>If enabled, an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary "

"open faster, but at the expense of longer Plasma startup times (but you will "
"be able to work while it is loading, so you may not even notice that it is "
"taking longer).</p>"
