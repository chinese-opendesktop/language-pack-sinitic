"<h1>Joystick</h1>This module helps to check if your joystick is working "
"correctly.<br />If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to "
"solve this with the calibration.<br />This module tries to find all "
"available joystick devices by checking /dev/js[0-4] and /dev/input/"
"js[0-4]<br />If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox.<br /"
">The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes "
