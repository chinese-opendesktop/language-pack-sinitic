"Filters by default exclude items from the project. Inclusive patterns can be "
"used to include items which where matched by previous exclusive patterns."
"<br />E.g. to only include files ending on <code>\".cpp\"</code> in your "
"project, you could exclude all files via <code>\"*\"</code> and then apply "
"an inclusive <code>\"*.cpp\"</code> pattern."

msgid ""
"The wildcard pattern defines whether a file or folder is included in a "
"project or not.<br />The pattern is matched case-sensitively against the "
"items relative path to the project root. The relative path starts with a "
"forward slash, trailing slashes of folders are removed.<br />Patterns ending "
"on <code>\"/\"</code> are implicitly considered to match against folders "
"only.<br />Patterns which do not explicitly start with either <code>\"/\"</"
"code> or <code>\"*\"</code> implicitly get <code>\"*/\"</code> prepended and "
"thus match any item with a relative path ending on the given pattern."
