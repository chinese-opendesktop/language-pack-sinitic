"<p>The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move "
"on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller "
"than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set "
"to 1X;</p><p> thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, "
"there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over "
"the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can "
"move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.</p>"

msgid ""
"<p>This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance "
"that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the "
"physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other "
"pointing device.)</p><p> A high value for the acceleration will lead to "
"large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a "
"small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may "
"result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to "
"control.</p>"
