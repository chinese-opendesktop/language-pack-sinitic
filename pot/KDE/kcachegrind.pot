"<b>Detect recursive cycles</b><p>If this is switched off, the treemap "
"drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of "
"drawing the recursion ad infinitum. Note that the size of black areas often "
"will be wrong, as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be "
"determined; the error is small, however, for false cycles (see "
"documentation).</p><p>The correct handling for cycles is to detect them and "
"collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function, which is done "
"when this option is selected. Unfortunately, with GUI applications, this "
"often will lead to huge false cycles, making the analysis impossible; "
"therefore, there is the option to switch this off.</p>"

"<b>Force Dump</b><p>This forces a dump for a Callgrind profile run in the "
"current directory. This action is checked while KCachegrind looks for the "
"dump. If the dump is finished, it automatically reloads the current trace. "
"If this is the one from the running Callgrind, the new created trace part "
"will be loaded, too.</p><p>Force dump creates a file 'callgrind.cmd', and "
"checks every second for its existence. A running Callgrind will detect this "
"file, dump a trace part, and delete 'callgrind.cmd'. The deletion is "
"detected by KCachegrind, and it does a Reload. If there is <em>no</em> "
"Callgrind running, press 'Force Dump' again to cancel the dump request. This "
"deletes 'callgrind.cmd' itself and stops polling for a new dump.</p><p>Note: "
"A Callgrind run <em>only</em> detects existence of 'callgrind.cmd' when "
"actively running a few milliseconds, i.e. <em>not</em> sleeping. Tip: For a "
"profiled GUI program, you can awake Callgrind e.g. by resizing a window of "
