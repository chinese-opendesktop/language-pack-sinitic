"<p>Here you can get some assistance in setting up KMail's filter rules to "
"use some commonly-known anti-virus tools.</p><p>The wizard can detect those "
"tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages "
"using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses. The wizard "
"will not take any existing filter rules into consideration: it will always "
"append the new rules.</p><p><b>Warning:</b> As KMail appears to be frozen "
"during the scan of the messages for viruses, you may encounter problems with "
"the responsiveness of KMail because anti-virus tool operations are usually "
"time consuming; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the "
"wizard to get back to the former behavior.</p>"
