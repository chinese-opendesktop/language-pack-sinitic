"<h1>Sound System</h1> Here you can configure aRts, KDE's sound server. This "
"program not only allows you to hear your system sounds while simultaneously "
"listening to an MP3 file or playing a game with background music. It also "
"allows you to apply different effects to your system sounds and provides "
"programmers with an easy way to achieve sound support."

"Normally, the sound server defaults to using a sampling rate of 44100 Hz (CD "
"quality), which is supported on almost any hardware. If you are using "
"certain <b>Yamaha soundcards</b>, you might need to configure this to 48000 "
"Hz here, if you are using <b>old SoundBlaster cards</b>, like SoundBlaster "
"Pro, you might need to change this to 22050 Hz. All other values are "
"possible, too, and may make sense in certain contexts (i.e. professional "
"studio equipment)."

"Normally, the sound server defaults to using the device called <b>/dev/dsp</"

"devfs is used, however, you may need to use <b>/dev/sound/dsp</b> instead. "

"you have a soundcard that supports multiple outputs, or you have multiple "
"soundcards."
