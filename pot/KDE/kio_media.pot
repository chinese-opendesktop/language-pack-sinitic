"<h3><b>All Data</b></h3>\n"
"           All  data  is  committed into the journal prior to being written "
"into the main file system. This is the slowest variant with the highest data "
"security.\n"
"\n"
"<h3><b>Ordered</b></h3>\n"
"           All data is forced directly out to the main  file system prior to "

"<h3><b>Write Back</b></h3>\n"
"           Data ordering is not preserved - data may be written into the "
"main file system after its metadata has been committed to the journal.  This "
"is rumoured to  be the  highest-throughput option.  It guarantees internal "
"file system integrity,  however it can allow old data to appear in files "
"after  a  crash  and  journal recovery."
