"mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened "
"to his message. Common disposition types include <b>displayed</b> (i.e. "
"read), <b>deleted</b> and <b>dispatched</b> (e.g. forwarded).</p><p>The "
"following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs:</"
"p><ul><li><em>Ignore</em>: Ignores any request for disposition "
"notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended).</"
"li><li><em>Ask</em>: Answers requests only after asking the user for "
"permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying "
"or ignoring them for others.</li><li><em>Deny</em>: Always sends a "
"<b>denied</b> notification. This is only <em>slightly</em> better than "
"always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been "
"acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc.</"
"li><li><em>Always send</em>: Always sends the requested disposition "
"notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when "
"the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, "
"deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much "
"sense e.g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available."
