" - the list of keywords in language A has been translated into language B "
msgstr ""

msgid " - there are enough documents from country B in the database "
msgstr ""

msgid " Additionally, GNU Edu brings the concept of educational skill. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" An skill is an elementary part of a specification of what is to be learned. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" By combining several skills, you get a rather good description of what an "
"educational material is supposed to teach. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" Each GNU Edu skill acts as a pivot to enable educators from different "
"country and educational systems to talk to each other. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" Either upload your document directly from the home page (\"new uploaded "
"resources\", then \"Quickly add a resource\") "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" GNU Edu documents can be searched by curriculum or by keywords, and are "
"categorized by learning resource type and other categories defined elsewhere "
"in international standards like Dublin Core and Learning Object Model (LOM). "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" GNU Edu is a database for sharing all kinds of documents meant for "
"teaching, over the Internet.  We call these documents \"educational resources"
"\". "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" GNU Edu is useful for everybody interested in education, at all levels and "
"for all ages. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" In different countries, the same skills are often taught at different "
"ages.  For example in Germany, some elements of the theory of probability "
"are taught in middle school classes (12-13 yrs old) but in France the same "
"concepts are taught only at the age of 16. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" In general, the diversity of what is taught at what age is great.  It "
"depends on a country, even a region.  It also depends on a specific "
"curriculum, in many countries there are also different kinds of schools at "
"the same age. "
msgstr ""

msgid " In practice, this will happen provided "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" In principle, a user in country A can select a keyword from a list in his "
"own language, or type it in a search box, and retrieve a list of skills, "
"then a list of resources from country B. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" Main users should be teachers, also parents, students, researchers ... and "
"the curious. "
msgstr ""

msgid " NB: You may need to create an account. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" Or, preferably, get to the place where you would like your document to be "
"added (choose subject and country, then chapters or keywords, then skills), "
"and click on \"Add a resource\". "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" Skills can be about remembering a concept (notion), or understanding a "
"theory, or being able to perform a definite task (competency) or engaging in "
"a certain process (analyzing, searching, or singing, drawing, etc ...) "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" There is a need for a finer and more understanding granularity of "
"educational skills.  For example, if you search for \"pythagorean theorem\" "
"you need to make clear whether your document is about proving the theorem, "
"or about computing the length of one side in a triangle. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" There is a need for classification.  We want this classification to be "
"independent from any country or culture. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" There is a reference to this concept, or similar ones, in many learning "
"theories.  Yet in GNU Edu, skills do not refer to any specific learning "
"theory. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" These resources can be used for teaching, either online (in HTML or "
"scripting languages or image, video, sound ...), or offline (any format). "
msgstr ""

msgid " Well, GNU Edu uses keyword searching but it is not sufficient. "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" With GNU Edu \"educational resources\", we mean any resource that either "
"are already online or can be uploaded through GNU Edu interface. "
msgstr ""
