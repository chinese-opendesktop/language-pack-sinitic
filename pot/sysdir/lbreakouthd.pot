msgid "'Absolute' uses absolute mouse position. No fine tuning possible and you "

"'Relative' allows modifying paddle speed but might get inaccurate for slow "
"movements with high resolution and high frame rates."

msgid "'Auto' means no antialiasing for old LBreakout2 low resolution themes as "

"'Auto' is more convenient but 'Manually' might be required for (badly "
"designed) levels where balls need to bounce around a lot."
