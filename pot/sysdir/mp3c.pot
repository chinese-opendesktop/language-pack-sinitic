"HINTS\n"
"-------\n"
"\n"
"On-the fly encoding\n"
"MP3-file will be created without using a temporary-\n"
"file. Must be supported by your ripper (output wav \n"
"or cda to stdout) and your encoder (use wav or cda \n"
"input from stdin). This sometimes causes \"klicks\"  \n"
"on mp3-files. Streams will be buffered over a FIFO,\n"
"set size of FIFO in option-menu.                   \n"
"\n"
"Ripping all tracks before encoding\n"
"If you want to rip all tracks before encoding just \n"
"activate the flag in option-menu. Remember that you\n"
"should have enough space on your harddisk, since   \n"
"wav-data uses much space.                          \n"
"Ripped data is stored in the same temp-directory   \n"
"like normally, you don't have to change your old   \n"
"setting. An unique number is inserted without      \n"
"destroying any \".wav\"-ending.                      \n"
"\n"
"Replace slash character\n"
"You can set a character which is inserted instead  \n"
"of slashs in option-menu. This prevents sensless   \n"
"directory creation if a songtitle contains a slash.\n"
"\n"
"Character set\n"
"You cannot input all characters or some characters \n"
"are missing in CDBB-entries (eg Umlauts, etc)? Just\n"
"set character-handling to \"non-strict\" in option-  \n"
"menu.                                              \n"
"\n"
"CDDB\n"
"No internet-connection? Just input \"0\" as CDDB-    \n"
"server, and only local database is used.           \n"
"\n"
"Filename-Creation\n"
"You have lots of options for filename-creation.    \n"
"The first thing is to set the root-directory for   \n"
"your mp3-files. Then create a pattern-mask for the \n"
"filenames (here you can use several patterns for   \n"
"inserting artistname, songtitle, etc. You can even \n"
"use slashes to split the files into different      \n"
"directorys). Furthermore you can set if you accept \n"
"spaces in filenames or not and you can input a list\n"
"with all characters you don't like in filenames.   \n"
"Each character which is killed is then replaced by \n"
"an defined char or left out. You can select what   \n"
"you like by setting \"Patternmode\" in option-menu.  \n"
"A nice additional feature is to convert characters \n"
"toupper if the previous was killed. This is really \n"
"nice if you kill every space without converting    \n"
"them to underscores. Just try option-menu for all  \n"
"the features.                                      \n"
"\n"
"Ripping several cds before encoding\n"
"As introduced with version 0.21 you can rip several\n"
"tracks, without doing encoding. Each ripped track  \n"
"is placed on the right window. Of course the old   \n"
"behavior is still possible (F3 and F4), but you can\n"
"also use F6 to rip all marked tracks (or F7 to rip \n"
"the actual track) without encoding. (If you use F3 \n"
"or F4 and encoding fails, the already ripped track \n"
"is saved).                                         \n"
"On the right side you can do the same like on the  \n"
"left one: mark tracks, encode one or all and open a\n"
"setup window with ENTER-key. Furthermore you can   \n"
"delete one or all marked tracks by using F8 and F9.\n"

"Well, no problem. Just export the ripped tracks and do\n"

"path MP3c was stored in (\"/usr/etc\" for distributed  \n"
"versions and \"/usr/local/etc\" if you self installed  \n"
"MP3c). You can set global-path to \"/etc\" by changing \n"
"\"mp3creat.h\" before compiling it.                    \n"
"To dump actual configuration just use \"Save Config\"  \n"
"in option-menu, or enable \"Auto Save\" to save before \n"
"leaving MP3c.                                        \n"
"The configurationfile is an normal ascii-text file.  \n"
"You can edit it manually without any risks, each key \n"
"stored in it has a lot of comments, so you should    \n"
"understand the file easily.                          \n"
