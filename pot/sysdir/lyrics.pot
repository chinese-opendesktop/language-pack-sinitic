"Choosing this option, the current URL will be attached to the current file. "

"to search for it again. This information can be stored between sessions, as "
"long as your playlist stores metadata about the multimedia items (almost all "
"the playlists do). If you want to be able to search for other lyrics for "
"this music, you must select this option again to clear the stored URL."

"For your query, you can use any property of your multimedia item, just "

"\n"
"Some common properties used are $(title), $(author) and $(album). For "

"In order to find the lyrics for the current song, this plugin uses the "
"properties stored with each song, such as its title, author and album. These "
"properties are usually retrieved by a tag reader, but in some cases they may "
"not be present or be incorrect. In that case, the Lyrics plugin will not be "
"able to find the lyrics until these properties are fixed (you can fix them "
"using the tag editor).\n"
"Hint: The lucky tag plugin, present in the kdeaddons module, can try to "
"guess properties such as title and author from the filename of a song. "
"Enabling it may increase the probability of finding lyrics."
