"You can select files with the mouse and copy them to the directory listed\n"
"in the other part of the window by right-clicking on the list and selecting\n"
"the copy command from the context-menu. You can also print files, make new\n"
"directories and delete files or directories. If you choose \"Text mode for "
"copying\"\n"
"from the \"Options\" menu, files will be copied to / from floppy using "
"appropriate\n"
"CR-LF translation for DOS text files. This is achieved using mcopy's -t "

msgid "People often experience problems when they want to transport big amounts\n"
"of data which do not fit onto a single medium. MToolsFM tries to make this \n"
"relatively easy for most people now. If you have one big file which you "
"would\n"
"like to transport somewhere on a floppy, for example, you can select that "
"file\n"
"in the \"Harddisk\"-view and choose the \"Split\"-menuitem from the \"Utility"
"\"-menu.\n"
"This will allow you to split the file into serveral small files which will "
"each fit\n"
"onto a single medium. The files will be called\n"
"\n"
"split-<num>.aa, split-<num>.ab, split-<num>.ac,...,\n"
"\n"
"wherer <num> is some number. Internally, MToolsFM makes use of the \"split\"-"
"command to\n"
"generate these files. You have the choice between two default file sizes "
"suited for \n"
"floppy disks, but you can also enter a custom file size in bytes.\n"
"When you reassemble all these files in a single directory at your "
"destination, you\n"
"may use the UNIX cat command to put the pieces together in the following "
"way:\n"
"\n"
"cat split-<num>.aa split-<num>.ab split-<num>.ac >your-file\n"
"\n"
"where \"your-file\" should be the original filename.\n"
"If the destination system is DOS- or Windows-based, life is really easy - "
"MToolsFM\n"
"will generate a file with the name split-<num>.bat for you. If you run this "
"file under\n"
"DOS / Windows in the directory where you have copied all the small files, it "
"will \n"
"automatically put the pieces together again (The batch file makes use of the "
"\"copy\"-\n"
"command). So all you would have to do is doubleclick on that batch file in "
"the\n"

"possibilities to put several files and even directories into one single big "
"file -\n"

"menu.\n"
"zip is probably good for most DOS / windows systems - the other options are "
