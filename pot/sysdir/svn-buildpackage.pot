"Usage: svn-buildpackage [ OPTIONS... ] [ OPTIONS for dpkg-buildpackage ]\n"
"Builds Debian package within the SVN repository. The source code\n"
"repository must be in the format created by svn-inject, and this script\n"
"must be executed from the work directory (trunk/package).\n"
"\n"
"Building and working directory management:\n"
"  --svn-builder CMD    Use CMD as build command instead of dpkg-"
"buildpackage\n"
"  --svn-ignore-new     Don't stop on svn conflicts or new/changed files\n"
"  --svn-dont-clean     Don't run debian/rules clean (default: clean first)\n"
"  --svn-savecfg        Create a .svn/deb-layout file from the detected/"
"imported\n"
"                       layout information. (replicates old behaviour)\n"
"Source copying behavior:\n"
"  --svn-no-links       Don't use file links (default: use links where "
"possible)\n"
"  --svn-dont-purge     Don't wipe the build directory (default: purge after "
"build)\n"
"  --svn-reuse          Reuse an existing build directory, copy trunk over "
"it\n"
"  --svn-rm-prev-dir    Remove an existing build directory instead of making "

"                       copy; if --svn-reuse is specified, this option is "

"  --svn-retag          Replace an existing tag directory if found while "

"  --svn-only-tag       Tags the current trunk directory without building\n"
"  --svn-noautodch      Don't add a new Debian changelog entry when done\n"
"Post-build processing:\n"
"  --svn-lintian        Run lintian after the build\n"
"  --svn-move           Move package files to .. after successful build\n"
"  --svn-move-to XYZ    Move package files to XYZ, implies --svn-move\n"
"Miscelaneous:\n"
"  --svn-pkg PACKAGE    Specifies the package name\n"
"  --svn-override a=b   Override some config variable (comma separated list)\n"
"  --svn-arch ARCH      Allows specifying the build architecture\n"
"  --svn-verbose        More verbose program output\n"
"  --svn-noninteractive Turn off interactive mode\n"
