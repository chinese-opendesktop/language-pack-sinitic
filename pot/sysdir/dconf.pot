"enums and flags. The 'always-confirm-implicit' and 'always-confirm-explicit' "
"values always asks for confirmation, but the first applies the change if you "
"change path whereas the second dismiss it. The 'always-delay' value adds "
"each change in delay mode, allowing to apply multiple keys at once."
