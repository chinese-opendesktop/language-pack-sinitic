"The torr unit was named after the physicist and mathematician Evangelista "
"Torricelli who discovered the principle of the barometer in 1644 and "
"demonstrated the first mercury barometer to the general public. A pressure "
"of 1 torr is approximately equal to one millimeter of mercury, and one "
"standard atmosphere (atm) equals 760 Torr."

"The weight of the air that makes up the atmosphere exerts a pressure on the "
"surface of the Earth, which is known as atmospheric pressure. To make it "
"easier to compare the value to other values for locations with different "
"altitudes, atmospheric pressure is adjusted to the equivalent sea-level "
"pressure and called barometric pressure. Rising barometric pressures "
"generally indicate an improvement in weather conditions, while falling "
"pressures mean deterioration."
