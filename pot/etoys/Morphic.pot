"An Event Roll is a used to visualize and edit the score, or \"tape\", of an "
"Event Theatre's \"event movie\".\n"
"\n"
"The Roll shows three \"tracks\", one for all Mouse events, one for Keyboard "
"events, and one for all other events, such as sound.\n"
"\n"
"You can *remove* any item from an event roll by just picking it up with the "
"mouse and dropping it anywhere outside the roll (such as on the desktop or "
"in the trash-can.)  If in doubt about the effect of removing an item, you "
"can put it on the desktop, play the revised tape, then pick up the event "
"from the desktop and drop it back near where you found it in the event roll, "
"and replay again to compare.\n"
"\n"
"You can *reposition* any item in an event roll by picking it up with the "
"mouse and dropping it anywhere else in the roll.  CAUTION:  Items in the "
"mouse-event track should not be dropped such that they overlap -- see caveat "
"below under \"Tips\".\n"
"\n"
"You can drag various kinds of items *into* the roll.  For example, you can "
"drop a \"Morph\" or a \"Tile\" obtained from a SoundRecorder, and you can "
"drop a \"button\" representing another event-recorded sequence (though it is "
"not at the moment recommended to do the latter.)  One straightforward way of "
"adding voiceovers to an existing event recording is to play back the "
"recording while selectively making individual snippets of voice recordings "
"using a separate, standard Squeak SoundRecording tool.  After you are "
"satisfied with a recording, obtain a \"morph\" from the sound-recording "
"tool, and position it as desired in the event roll.\n"
"\n"
"You can *resize* items in the \"mouse\" track of an event roll.  When you "
"stretch or shrink a mouse-sequence, the events within the sequence get "
"remapped linearly within the duration represented by the new size of the "
"sequence as seen in the event roll.  [CAUTION:  Do not resize a mouse item "
"such that it will overlap an adjacent one.  It is a bug that this is even "
"allowed.]\n"
"\n"
"In addition to adding separately-recorded voiceovers using the mechanism "
"described in item 3 above, there is a built-in voiceover mechanism in the "
"Event Theatre.  Whenever you are playing back an existing event-recording in "
"an Event Theatre, a \"Record Voiceover\" button will appear.  If you press "
"this, the playback of the event recording will continue and you can record a "
"voiceover to go with any portion you wish.  When you are done recording a "
"snippet, you can hit the \"stop recording voiceover\" button; playback will "
"continue, and you can subsequently, on this pass or any future one, add more "
"voiceover snippets.  To remove a voiceover snippet, simply drag it out of "
"the event roll; to reposition it, simply pick it up with the mouse and drop "
"it back into the event roll at the desired position.\n"
"\n"
"When you make a change in an Event Roll, it will immediately change the tape "
"of the Event Theatre, so that when you replay the event-movie you will "
"immediately see see the change.  If you are unhappy with the change, there "
"is a one-level \"undo\" available which will revert the EventTheatre to its "
"state before the last edit you made in the EventRoll.  There is also a "
"\"deeper\" level of \"undo\" available that will revert the EventTheatre "
"(and hence the associated EventRoll) to the initial state they were in when "
"you first launched the event roll.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Keyboard Track\n"
"\n"
"You can reposition or delete any keyboard-track item.\n"
"\n"
"Color conventions in the keyboard track: (These will change soon!)\n"
"\n"
"\tWhite\tSimple lower-case character, no modifier key pressed\n"
"\tRed\t\tShift-key pressed\n"
"\tGreen\tAlt-key pressed\n"
"\tYellow\tControl-key pressed\n"
"\n"
"\tYellow\tA \"space\" character\n"
"\tBlue\t\tA \"backspace\" character\n"
"\n"
"Unprintable characters are shown in red with the ascii value displayed, e.g. "
"#13 for a \"return\" character.\n"
"\n"
"*Important Tips*\n"
"\n"
"(1)  To get the halo on an object inside an EventRoll, hold down the SHIFT "
"key as you halo-click on the object.\n"
"\n"
"(2)  DO NOT reposition or resize mouse-track items such that any two of them "
"overlap, since this will result in the events represented by the two items "
"getting co-mingled in such a way that they you will never be able to "
"separate them again, and the mixture will have crazy results.  It is a bug "
"that you are allowed to drop mouse-track items such that they overlap.  So "
"please, DO NOT DO IT!  If by accident you do, you might be interested in "
"trying out some of the revert mechanisms in the system.\n"

"\n"
"Mines is a very simple, yet extremely frustrating, game to play. The rules "
"are just this: there are 99 mines laid down on the board. Find them without "
"\"\"finding\"\" them. Your first tile is free - click anywhere. The tiles "
"will tell you how many mines are right next to it, including the diagonals. "
"If you uncover the number '2', you know that there are two mines hidden in "
"the adjacent tiles. If you think you have found a mine, you can flag it by "
"either 'shift' clicking, or click with the 'yellow' mouse button. Once you "
"have flagged all of the mines adjacent to a numbered tile, you can click on "
"the tile again to uncover the rest. Of course, you could be wrong about "

"The Event Theatre provides a framework for authoring \"event-movies\".  It "
"uses custom variants of the Navigator, the Supplies flap, the painting "
"system, property sheets, Viewer flaps, etc., all of which reside within the "
"controlled confines of the Theatre.\n"
"\n"
"To author an event-movie, get a  new Event Theatre from the Objects catalog "
"or from the \"open...\" branch of the desktop menu.\n"
"\n"
"1. Resize the Theatre, using the halo, to the delivery size desired for "
"playback.\n"
"\n"
"2. Use the menu in the controls panel to add or delete Supplies and "
"Navigator flaps as desired.\n"
"\n"
"3. Edit the \"caption\" by clicking on the text that says \"Untitled\" and "
"typing your desired caption.  This caption is affixed to playback buttons, "
"and, generally, provides a way to identify the event-movie.\n"
"\n"
"4. Set up the \"initial conditions\" for the event-movie you're about to "
"record (e.g., paint a background, provide some explanatory text, add objects "
"you want to be present at the start of the movie.) When the recording is "
"first opened by the user for playback, and whenever the recording has been "
"rewound, this is exactly what it will look like.\n"
"\n"
"5. When ready to start the recording, press the \"Record\" button. A red "
"border will be seen around the recorder, to indicate that recording is in "
"progress.  Recording will continue until you hit the ESC key.\n"
"\n"
"6. Note that if you  want to include sound in your recording, you can add it "
"directly during playback, or you can produce voiceover externally and add it "
"in later using the Event Roll.\n"
"\n"
"7. Now proceed to \"do\", with the mouse and keyboard, whatever you wish to "
"record.   For best results, all mouse gestures should be made within the "
"interior of the Theatre.\n"
"\n"
"8. Hit ESC when done recording.\n"
"\n"
"9. To review what you've recorded, press \"Play\". If unhappy with the "
"result, repeat steps 1-8.\n"
"\n"
"10.  If you're happy with the result, and now wish to add a sound, open the "
"sound panel, then click Play to replay the recording, and whenever you wish "
"to add a snippet of voiceover, click on the \"Start Recording Voiceover\" "
"button, and start talking, and when done with that snippet click the \"Stop "
"Recording Voiceover\" button.  Once the playback finishes, the added "
"voiceover(s) will become part of the event tape, and will be seen in the "
"event roll.\n"
"\n"
"11. When you're happy with the result, hit the \"Publish\" button, to get a "
"playback button. There are currently two choices:\n"
"\n"
"a. Iconic Button - Initially provides a picture of the initial scene of the "
"movie, scaled 0.3x, and overlaid with the word HINT.  When the user clicks "
"on such a button, the event-movie is played back in an ephemeral \"playback "
"theatre\", and after the playback is done, the playback theatre shrinks down "
"to a 0.5x scale-downed picture of the *final* scene of the movie.  "
"Subsequent hitting of the button will again invoke a playback.\n"
"\n"
"b. Textual Button - a simple labeled button which, when pressed, triggers "
"playback of the event tape.\n"
"\n"
"12. The playback buttons you obtain when you \"Publish\" can be placed "
"anywhere, such as on the page of a book. You can control, via a playback-"
"button's halo menu, whether or not it should be \"auto-start\", and whether "
"or not \"auto-dismiss\". When the user presses the button, a \"Playback\" "
"space will open, which resembles an Event Theatre, but has only playback-"
"relevant controls.   A playback set up for both auto-start and auto-dismiss "
"comes without any controls.\n"
"\n"
"13.  To edit the \"event tape\" of a recording you have made in an Event "
"Theatre, and for a generally good time, click on the interlocking-circles "
"icon to obtain a tool that allows you to visualize and to edit a \"score\" "
"or \"piano roll\" of the event tape.\n"

"\n"
