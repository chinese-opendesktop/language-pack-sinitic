msgid ""
"Flaps are like drawers on the edge of the screen, which can be opened so "
"that you can use what is inside them, and closed when you do not need them.  "
"They have many possible uses, a few of which are illustrated by the default "
"set of flaps you can get as described below.\n"
"\n"
" 'Shared flaps' are available in every morphic project.  As you move from "
"project to project, you will see these same shared flaps in each, though "
"there are also options, on a project-by-project basis, to choose which of "
"the shared flaps should be shown, and also momentarily to suppress the "
"showing of all shared flaps.   \n"
"\n"
" To get started using flaps, bring up the desktop menu and choose "
"'flaps...', and make the menu stay up by choosing 'keep this menu up'.  If "
"you see, in this flaps menu,  a list of flap names such as 'Squeak', "
"'Tools', etc., it means that shared flaps are already set up in your image.  "
"If you do not see the list, you will instead see a menu item that invites "
"you to 'install default shared flaps'; choose that, and new flaps will be "
"created, and the flaps menu will change to reflect their presence.\n"
"\n"
" 'Project flaps' are flaps that belong to a single morphic project.  You "
"will see them when you are in that project, but not when you are in any "
"other morphic project.\n"
"\n"
" If a flap is set up as a parts bin (such as the default Tools and Supplies "
"flaps), you can use it to create new objects -- just open the flap, then "
"find the object you want, and drag it out; when the cursor leaves the flap, "
"the flap itself will snap closed, and you'll be left holding the new object "
"-- just click to place it exactly where you want it.\n"
"\n"
" If a flap is *not* set up as a parts bin (such as the default 'Squeak' flap "
"at the left edge of the screen) you can park objects there (this is an easy "
"way to move objects from project to project) and you can place your own "
"private controls there, etc.  Everything in the default 'Squeak' flap (and "
"all the other default flaps, for that matter) is there only for illustrative "
"purposes -- every user will want to fine-tune the flaps to suit his/her own "
"style and needs.\n"
"\n"
" Each flap may be set up to appear on mouseover, dragover, both, or "
"neither.  See the menu items described below for more about these and other "
"options.\n"
"\n"
" You can open a closed flap by clicking on its tab, or by dragging the tab "
"toward the center of the screen\n"
"\n"
" You can close an open flap by clicking on its tab or by dragging the tab "
"back off the edge of the screen.\n"
"\n"
" Drag the tab of a flap to reposition the tab and to resize the flap "
"itself.  Repositioning starts when you drag the cursor out of the original "
"tab area.\n"
"\n"
" If flaps or their tabs seem wrongly positioned or lost, try issuing a "
"restoreDisplay from the screen menu.\n"
"\n"
" The red-halo menu on a flap allows you to change the flap's properties.   "
"For greatest ease of use, request 'keep this menu up' here -- that way, you "
"can easily explore all the options in the menu.\n"
"\n"
" tab color...\t\t\t\tLets you change the color of the flap's tab.\n"
" flap color...\t\t\t\tLets you change the color of the flap itself.\n"
"\n"
" use textual tab...\t\tIf the tab is not textual, makes it become textual.\n"
" change tab wording...\tIf the tab is already textual, allows you to edit\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits wording.\n"
"\n"
" use graphical tab...\t\tIf the tab is not graphical, makes it become\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgraphical.\n"
" choose tab graphic...\tIf the tab is already graphical, allows you\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto change the picture.\n"
"\n"
" use solid tab...\t\t\tIf the tab is not solid, makes it become solid, i.e.\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappear as a solid band of color along the\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentire length or width of the screen.\n"
"\n"
" parts-bin behavior\t\tIf set, then dragging an object from the flap\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttears off a new copy of the object.\n"
"\n"
" dragover\t\t\t\tIf set, the flap opens on dragover and closes\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagain on drag-leave.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
" mouseover\t\t\t\tIf set, the flap opens on mouseover and closes\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagain on mouse-leave. \n"
"\n"
" cling to edge...\t\t\tGoverns which edge (left, right, top, bottom)\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe flap adheres to.\n"
"\n"
" shared\t\t\t\t\tIf set, the same flap will be available in all projects; if "
"not, the\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflap will will occur only in one project.\n"
"\n"
" destroy this flap\t\tDeletes the flap.\n"
"\n"
" To define a new flap, use 'make a new flap', found in the 'flaps' menu.\n"
"\n"
" To reinstate the default system flaps, you can use 'destroy all shared "
"flaps' from the 'flaps' menu, and once they are destroyed, choose 'install "
"default shared flaps'.\n"
"\n"
" To add, delete, or edit things on a given flap, it is often wise first to "
"suspend the flap's mouse-over and drag-over sensitivity, so it won't keep "
"disappearing on you while you're trying to work with it.\n"
"\n"
" Besides the three standard flaps delivered with the default system, there "
"are two other flaps readily available on demand from the 'flaps' menu -- one "
"is called 'Stack Tools', which provides some tools useful for building stack-"
"like content, the other is called 'Painting', which provides a quick way to "
"make a new painting.  Simply clicking on the appropriate checkbox in the "
"'flaps' menu will toggle the corresponding flap between being visible and "
"not being visible in the project."
