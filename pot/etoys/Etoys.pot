"A \"stack\" is a place where you can create, store, view and retrieve data "
"\"fields\" from a set of \"cards\".  Data that you want to occur on every "
"card (such as a name and an address in an Address Stack) are represented by "
"objects such as \"Simple Text\", \"Fancy Text\", and \"Scrolling Text\" that "
"you obtain from the Stack Tools flap.\n"
"\n"
"When you look at a card in a Stack, you may be seeing three different kinds "
"of material.  Press the § button in the stack's controls to see the current "
"designations, and use the \"explain designations\" to get a reminder of what "
"the three different colors mean.\n"
"·  Things that are designated to be seen on every card, and have the same "
"contents whichever card is being shown. (green)\n"
"·  Things that are designated to be seen on every card, with each card "
"having its own value for them. (orange)\n"
"·  Things that are designated to occur only on the particular card at hand. "
"(red)\n"
"\n"
"Use the \"stack/cards\" menu (in an object's halo menu) to change the "
"designation of any object.  For example, if you have an object that is "
"private to just one card, and you want to make it visible on all cards, use "
"\"place onto background\".  If you further want it to hold a separate value "
"for each separate card, use \"start holding separate data for each instance"
"\".\n"
"\n"
"The normal sequence to define a Stack's structure is to obtain a blank "
"Stack, then create your fields by grabbing what you want from the Stack "
"Tools flap and dropping it where you want it in the stack.  For easiest use, "
"give a name to each field (by editing the name in its halo) *before* you put "
"it onto the background..  Those fields that you want to represent the basic "
"data of the stack need to be given names, placed on the background, and then "
"told to hold separate data.\n"
"\n"
"When you hit the + button in a stack's controls, a new card is created with "
"default values in all the fields.  You can arrange for a particular default "
"value to be used in a field -- do this either for one field at a time with "
"\"be default value on new card\", or you can request that the all the values "
"seen on a particular card serve as default by choosing \"be defaults for new "
"cards\" from the stack's · menu.\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have multiple \"backgrounds\" in the same stack -- "
"each different background defines a different data structure, and cards from "
"multiple backgrounds can be freely mixed in the same stack.\n"
"\n"
"Besides text fields, it is also possible to have picture-valued fields -- "
"and potentially fields with data values of any other type as well."

"* If \"tickers only\" is *not* checked, then all scripts will be shown, "

"\n"
"* The other checkbox, labeled \"all instances\", only comes into play if you "
"have created \"multiple sibling instances\" (good grief) of the same object, "
"which share the same scripts; if you have such things, it is often "
"convenient to see the scripts of just *one* such sibling, because it will "
"take up less space and require less mindshare -- and note that you can "
"control a script for an object *and* all its siblings from the menu of that "
"one that you see, via menu items such as \"propagate status to siblings\".\n"
"\n"
"* If \"all instances\" is checked, scripts for all sibling instances will be "
"shown, whereas if \"all instances\" is *not* checked, only one of each group "
"of siblings will be selected to have its scripts shown.\n"
"\n"
"But how do you get \"multiple sibling instances\" of the same object?  There "
"are several ways:\n"
"\n"
"(1)  Use the \"make a sibling instance\" or the \"make multiple siblings..."
"\" menu item in the halo menu of a scripted object.\n"
"\n"
"(2)  Use the \"copy\" tile in a script.\n"
"\n"
"(3)  Request \"give me a copy now\" from the menu associated with the \"copy"
"\" item in a Viewer.\n"
"\n"
"If you have on your screen multiple sibling instances of the same object, "
"then you may or may want to see them all in the All Scripts tool, and that "
"is what the \"all instances\" checkbox governs.\n"
"\n"
"Set \"all instances\" if you want a separate entry for each instance, as\n"
"opposed to a single representative of that kind of object.\n"
"\n"
"Note that if you obtain a copy of an object by using the green halo handle, "
"it will *not* be a sibling instance of the original.  It will in many ways "
"seem to be, because it will start out its life having the same scripts as "
"the original.  But it will then lead an independent life, so that changes to "
"scripts of the original will not be reflected in it, and vice-versa.\n"
"\n"
"This is an important distinction, and an unavoidable one because people "
"sometimes want the deep sharing of sibling instances and sometimes they "
"clearly do not.  But the truly understandable description of these concepts "
"and distinctions certainly lies *ahead* of us!"
