"<h4>...that KRec does non-destructive Recording?</h4>\n"
"<p>\n"
"That means if you have a recording and want to record only a part for a "
"second (third or more) time, your first (and second and later) version is "
"still on disc and can still be restored. Only for Playback/Export the old "
"version is overlayed by the newer one.\n"

"hesitate to mail us/me. You can find the email addresses of the author in "

"<p>\n"
"Some friends of mine asked me whether I could do the recordings for a "
"radioplay for them. So I was searching for an easy-to-use recording tool "
"running on my favorite OS. After some searching (without finding something "
"suitable) I started a first version of KRec.\n"
