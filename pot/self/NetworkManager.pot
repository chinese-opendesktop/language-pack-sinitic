"default value, which is 50 for VPNs and 100 for other connections. Note that "
"the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active connections.  It "
"does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the same connection "
"profile. When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top "
"of resolv.conf.  To prioritize a given server over another one within the "
"same connection, just specify them in the desired order.  When multiple "
"devices have configurations with the same priority, the one with an active "
"default route will be preferred.  Negative values have the special effect of "
"excluding other configurations with a greater priority value; so in presence "
"of at least a negative priority, only DNS servers from connections with the "
"lowest priority value will be used. When using a DNS resolver that supports "
"split-DNS as dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd-resolved, each connection is used to "
"query domains in its search list.  Queries for domains not present in any "
"search list are routed through connections having the '~.' special wildcard "
"domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route "
"(or can be added manually).  When multiple connections specify the same "
"domain, the one with the highest priority (lowest numerical value) wins.  If "
"a connection specifies a domain which is subdomain of another domain with a "
"negative DNS priority value, the subdomain is ignored."

"This represents the identity of the connection used for various purposes. It "

"stable-id can contain placeholders that are substituted dynamically and "
"deterministically depending on the context. The stable-id is used for "
"generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-"
"privacy. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for "
"ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable and wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable. It is "
"also used as DHCP client identifier with ipv4.dhcp-client-id=stable and to "
"derive the DHCP DUID with ipv6.dhcp-duid=stable-[llt,ll,uuid]. Note that "
"depending on the context where it is used, other parameters are also seeded "
"into the generation algorithm. For example, a per-host key is commonly also "
"included, so that different systems end up generating different IDs. Or with "
"ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy, also the device's name is included, so "
"that different interfaces yield different addresses. The '$' character is "

"the device. Any unrecognized patterns following '$' are treated verbatim, "

"escape it as \"$$\". For example, set it to \"${CONNECTION}-${BOOT}-"
"${DEVICE}\" to create a unique id for this connection that changes with "
"every reboot and differs depending on the interface where the profile "
