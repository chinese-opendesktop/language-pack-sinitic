"Here you can define at what interval KNewsTicker queries the configured news "
"sources for new headlines. This depends generally on how fast you would like "
"to hear about news and how much load you want to put on the network:<ul>\n"
"<li>A lower value (lower than <b>15 minutes</b>) enables you to get notified "
"about news very quickly if you want or need to. Please note that it "
"increases the network traffic significantly, though. Therefore, such low "
"values should not be used if you query popular news sites (such as <a href="
"\"http://slashdot.org\">Slashdot</a> or <a href=\"http://freshmeat.net"
"\">Freshmeat</a>) as they have generally already enough work processing the "
"incoming queries.</li>\n"
"<li>A higher value (higher than <b>45 minutes</b>) will make you hear about "
"news less quickly. For non-timecritical applications, it should be suitable, "
"though. The positive aspect of longer intervals is that only very little "
"load is put on the network; this saves resources and nerves, for you and the "
"system administrators of the news sites you query.</li></ul>\n"
"The default value (30 minutes) should be appropriate and reasonable in most "
"cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here you can define how fast the text should be scrolling. If you only have "
"a little space on your taskbar (and therefore a rather small news ticker), "
"you should probably set this to a slower speed so that you have a chance to "
"read the headlines. For wider news tickers (and better eyes), faster "
"scrolling is probably appropriate so that you do not have to wait too long "
"for the next headline."

"lower right corner.</li>\n"
"<li><b>Modifying</b> an existing filter is done in a similar manner: simply "

"\"kDe\".</li>\n"
"<li><b>equals</b>, <b>does not equal</b> - enter a phrase or expression here "
"to have the filter match only those articles whose headlines match "
"<b>exactly</b> the text you typed. The phrase you type will be considered to "
"be case-sensitive, so it makes a difference whether you show articles which "
"contain \"Boeing\" or \"BOEING\".</li>\n"
