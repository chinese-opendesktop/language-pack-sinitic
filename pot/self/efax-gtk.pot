"Sending faxes\n"
"-------------\n"
"\n"
"Before sending a fax, it must be specified in the \"Fax to send\" box. It "
"must be in postscript or PDF format (formats produced by all Unix/Linux word "
"and document processors), and will be converted by the program into the "
"correct tiffg3 fax format.\n"
"\n"
"There are two fax entry methods.  First, the fax to be sent can be a file "
"saved on the filesystem.  It can be entered manually in the \"Fax to send\" "
"box, or entered by means of the file selection dialog.  If the file "
"comprises a single postscript or PDF file, then you can find it by pressing "
"the \"Single File\" button.  It can be more easily found with this dialog if "
"it is placed in the $HOME/faxout directory.\n"
"\n"
"Where more than one file is specified in the \"Fax to send\" box, they will "
"be sent as a single fax appended in the order in which they are entered in "
"the box.  Such multiple files can be more easily selected using the file "
"list brought up by pressing the \"Multiple Files\" button.  Pressing the "
"\"Multiple Files\" button enables files to be found and added to the file "
"list, and they can be reordered by using the Up or Down arrow buttons, or by "
"dragging and dropping with the mouse.\n"
"\n"
"As an alternative, faxes can be received directly from the print system by "
"means of a socket server provided by the program.  Efax-gtk maintains a list "
"of queued faxes received from the socket which can be accessed by choosing "
"\"Socket\" as the fax entry method, and then bringing up the queued faxes "
"list by pressing the \"Socket list\" button.  This is a more convenient way "
"of sending faxes from a word processor, and enables a fax to be sent for "
"faxing to efax-gtk by printing from the word processor program.  Where a fax "
"is queued for sending in the socket list, a small red circle will appear in "
"the main program window on the right hand side of the \"Fax to send\" box.  "
"For particulars of how to set up CUPS or lpr/lprng to send to efax-gtk, see "
"the README file which comes with the distribution.\n"
"\n"
"The telephone number to which the fax is to be sent is entered into the "
"\"Tel number\" box.  This can be entered directly into the box, or by using "
"the built-in addressbook.  The addressbook can be invoked by pressing the "
"\"Tel number\" button, or from the `File/Address book' pull-down menu item "
"(see the \"Address Book\" tag in this help dialog). However, if a telephone "
"connection has already been established with the remote fax receiver, then "
"the fax can be sent without dialing by leaving the \"Tel number\" box blank "
"(a dialog will come up asking if you would like to send the fax without "
"dialing).\n"
"\n"
"When a fax is received from the print system via the socket server, the "
"program settings can also be configured to bring up a dialog automatically.  "
"If the program is inactive or is standing-by to receive faxes the fax can be "
"sent directly from this dialog without the need to invoke the list of queued "
"faxes received from the socket.\n"
"\n"
"Successfully sent faxes are copied to a directory in the $HOME/faxsent "
"directory, which has a name derived from the year, month, day, hour and "
"seconds when the sending of the fax was completed, and will appear in the "
"faxes sent list.  They are only included in that list if they have been sent "
"without error.  The efax message display box will report on the progress of "
"a fax being sent.  The fax list can be brought up from the `File/List sent "
"faxes' pull down menu item.  See \"Using the fax lists\" further below.\n"

"Automatic redialing\n"
"-------------------\n"
"\n"
"The program settings have an option for automatic redialing of a fax to be "
"sent if the modem was in use or the receiving station was busy when the "
"first attempt to send it was made.  A list of the faxes queued for redialing "

"system tray.\n"
"\n"
"If the program settings have been set to provide for automatic redialing, "
"the program will keep trying to send the fax at the intervals chosen in the "
"settings until either (a) the sending of the fax is successful, (b) there "
"has been a failure arising from something other than the modem being in use "
"or the recipient station being busy (such as a modem error, or the remote "
"number ringing out without answering), (c) the fax is removed by the user "
"from the list of faxes queued for redialing, (d) if the fax to be sent is a "
"print job received from the print system, the print job is removed by the "
"user from the dialog showing the list of queued faxes from the print socket, "
"(e) if the fax to be sent comprises file(s) on the file system, the file(s) "
"are deleted or moved (or their permissions changed to make them unreadable), "
"or (f) the 'Stop' button is pressed while an attempt is being made to send "
"the fax concerned which is queued for redialing.\n"
"\n"
"A fax queued for redialing will not be sent while the Settings dialog is "
"open.  Instead, if the interval for resending such a fax has passed, a "
"further sending attempt will take place once the Settings dialog has been "
"closed.\n"
"\n"
"The list of queued faxes for redialing is not preserved when the program is "
"terminated.  However, if any unsent faxes are print jobs received from the "
"print system, they can still be found in the dialog showing the list of "

"Receiving faxes\n"
"---------------\n"
"\n"
"Three ways of receiving faxes are provided for.\n"
"\n"
"First, the program can be set to answer a fax call which is ringing but has "
"not been answered, by pressing the \"Answer call\" button.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, the program can take over a call which has already been answered "
"(say, by a telephone hand set) by pressing the \"Take over call\" button.\n"
"\n"
"Thirdly, the program can be placed in standby mode by pressing the \"Standby"
"\" button.  This will automatically answer any call after the number of "
"rings specified in the efax-gtkrc file, and receive the fax. The program "
"will keep on receiving faxes until the \"Stop\" button is pressed.\n"
"\n"
"Received faxes in tiffg3 format (one file for each page) are placed in a "
"directory in the $HOME/faxin directory, which has a name derived from the "
"year, month, day, hour and seconds when reception of the fax was completed, "
"and is the fax ID number.\n"
"\n"
"Received faxes can be printed, viewed, described and managed using the built "
"in fax list facility.  This can be brought up from the `File/List received "
"faxes' pull down menu item.  See \"Using the fax lists\" further below.\n"
"\n"
"When a fax is received, a pop-up dialog can also be set to appear (go to the "
"Settings dialog to do this).  In the settings dialog you can also specify a "
"program to be executed when a fax is received.  The fax ID number is passed "
"as the first (and only) argument to the program, which enables the program "
"to find the fax in $HOME/faxin.  The distribution contains two executable "
"scripts, mail_fax and print_fax, which can be used to e-mail a fax or print "
"a fax to a user automatically when it is received.  (These scripts are not "
"installed by 'make install' - if you want to use them, make them executable "
"with 'chmod +x' and copy them to a directory which is in the system path "
"such as /usr/local/bin, and then specify the script name in the settings "
