" 1. Mapping the countryside.\n"
"\n"
"    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing a "
"warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around exploring the "
"countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a city undefended, so perhaps "
"keep the first warrior in the city, and use the following one to explore.  "

"the `Reports' menu, selecting `Players', clicking on the player with whom "
"you wish to meet, and finally clicking the `Meet' button below.  If the "
"entry under the embassy column is not blank and the other player is "
"connected (or is a server AI) then a diplomacy menu will pop up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 2. Defending the cities.\n"
"\n"
"    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior unit in "
"them.  As your civilization develops units with a greater defense strength, "
"replace the obsolete units with new ones to ensure your cities have maximum "
"defense.  The units most often used for defense are (in order of strength):  "
"Warrior, Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 3. Deciding which units to build first.\n"
"\n"
"    After building one or two Warrior units, start building Settlers.  The "
"second Settler can be used to build roads and irrigate the farmland close to "
"the city, and the third can be used to build a new city.  Or, you can use "
"the second Settler to build another city, and use the third Settler for "
"agricultural improvements in the farmland around the cities.  Keep in mind "
"that a large population increases both the amount of productivity and your "
"civilization's research rate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 4. Building agriculture improvements.\n"
"\n"
"    Each city has an area of farmland around it that can be used for growing "
"food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This can be increased by using "
"Settlers to improve the farmland. The land can be improved with roads, "
"irrigation, mines, and others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 5. Deciding where to build cities.\n"
"\n"
"    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which is "
"placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can also serve as a "
"port for sea-going units.  (They also usually need a coastal defense later "
"on.)  The best strategy is to build a few of both, but keep in mind that "
"your opponents will find it harder to locate your city if you don't build it "
"by the sea."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 6. Taking care of the cities.\n"
"\n"
"    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens depends on "
"the city's population.  When you click on a city, you can see how the "
"farmland around the city is being used.  You can assign your citizens to the "
"farmland, or they can be scientists, entertainers or taxmen.  Especially at "
"the start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are "
"employed so that they maximise growth, trade and production."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 7. Exploring the world.\n"
"\n"
"    After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes in the "
"cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world in search of "
"opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island, you should spend less on "
"military and more on expansion.  Or if you are located close to an opponent, "
"it is truly a good idea to make a peace treaty and share the advances you "
"have made. Diplomatic units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 8. Things to keep in mind.\n"
"\n"
"  - What the next advance you'll need is.\n"
"\n"
"  - What your tax, luxury and research rates are currently set to.\n"
"\n"
"  - Treaties are often broken, so don't neglect defense...\n"
"\n"
"  - Some wonders can be made obsolete by the development of certain advances."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 9. Making your own strategy for the game.\n"
"\n"
"    These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty well, "
"especially in the beginning of the game.  But to improve, you need to study "
"the various units and advances, and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  Freeciv "
"has many twists, so if you haven't played a similar game before, try "
"consulting the Freeciv WWW pages at http://www.freeciv.org/\n"

"- ZOC does not restrict unit attacks, only movement.\n"

"whenever possible, it keeps your cities content.\n"
"\n"
"There are various means to tell the governor what kind of output you would "
"like. Open the city window and click on the governor tab. There are two "
"kinds of sliders: On the left, you can set a Minimal Surplus for each kind "
"of production; e.g. Gold = +3 means the city earns 3 gold more than it needs "
"to upkeep its improvements. On the right, the sliders let you define by how "
"much you prefer one kind of production to another; setting science to 3 "
"means you prefer a single bulb to three shields (or gold, trade,...). You "
"can set different factors for each kind of production, according to your "
"needs.\n"
"\n"
"If you set up some Minimal Surpluses which are impossible to fulfill, the "
"governor can't be activated. Whenever the governor can't fulfill its task in "
"the ongoing game, it passes back control to you. So you'd better not define "
"too high a surplus; instead, use factors to achieve your goals.\n"
"\n"
"The Celebrate checkbox lets your city - celebrate. This will work only with "
"a high luxury rate. See help about 'Happiness'.\n"
"\n"
"Clicking on 'Control city' puts the city under control of the governor, "
"'Release city' passes control back to you.\n"
"\n"
"For ease of use, you can save your slider setting as a preset with a name. "
"Click on 'add preset' and enter a name for your setting. You can use this "
"preset in every city by just clicking on its name. Also, you can control "
"your setting from within the city report, in the governor column. And you "
"can change it from there (use 'change' --> 'Citizen Governor'), if you have "
"saved it as a preset.\n"
"\n"
"Use 'Game' --> 'Save Settings' to store your presets permanently.\n"
"\n"
"But beware! If you use the governor for some of your cities, you will "
"encounter some difficulties with managing cities nearby, by hand. It's best "
"to manage all cities on an island either by hand or by governor. Read more "
