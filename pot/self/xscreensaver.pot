"The ``blitspin'' hack repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using "
"logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants "
"are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively "
"smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated "
"in parallel. Written by Jamie Zawinski based on some cool SmallTalk code "

"dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. You can "

"This little gem does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. The gist of it "

"the vertices on these faces have forces on them in the form of one "
"proportional to their distance from the surface of a sphere, and one which "
"is proportional to how far they differ from some ideal distance from their "
"neighbors. They also have inertia. The forces and distance are parameters "
"and there are also a couple of visual parameters. The resulting effect can "
"range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere "
"in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of "
"disturbing manner. woo. It doesn't matter, however. You should just pick "
"'random'. It overrides all the other options, except for fps, delay and "
