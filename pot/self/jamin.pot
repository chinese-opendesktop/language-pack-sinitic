"    The File menu has the standard options available.  Save and Save As "

"    The Edit menu has undo and redo options for changes to the settings.\n"
"    The Ports menu allows you to set the input and output ports for JAMin.\n"
"    The Options menu has EQ Options and Preferences entries.  The EQ Options "
"dialog allows you to set the minimum and maximum gain level in dB for both "
"the HDEQ and GEQ.  You can also set the source of the spectrum for both the "
"HDEQ and spectrum windows.  Spectrum update frequency can be set here as "
"well.  Up to 10 per second (default) and down to 0 (disabled).\n"
"    Colors may be changed in the Options->Preferences dialog.  These colors "
"are saved in the file $HOME/.jamin-defaults.  This is done whenever you exit "
"from JAMin.  You can actually edit this file and change the colors by hand.  "
"They are just RGB values in the 0-65535 range but it's much easier to use "

"crossover type).\n"
"    For help on the rest of the GUI, context specific help can be obtained "

"    The adjustable crossover is used to split the entire audible range into "
"three sections.  It applies to the compressors and stereo widths. If the "
"crossovers are set to 500Hz and 5KHz then the first stereo width control and "
"compressor works for 25-500Hz, the second for 500Hz-5KHz, and the last for "
"5KHz-20KHz.  The crossover has no effect on the HDEQ unless one or more "
"bands are soloed.  The crossover bars that are visible in the HDEQ serve as "
"a visual reference.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    The compressors allow you to set compression parameters for each "
"compressor band.  The bands are defined by the crossover that can be set "
"using the crossover faders or the crossover bars in the HDEQ.  The "
"parameters are, from left to right:\n"
"\n"
"    A - attack in milliseconds\n"
"    R - release in milliseconds\n"
"    T - threshold in db\n"
"    r - compression ratio (N:1)\n"
"    K - knee (0.0 [hard] to 1.0 [soft])\n"
"    M - makeup gain in db\n"
"    Note that the value label for makeup gain is also the automatic makeup "
"gain button.  Pressing this will cause JAMin to try to approximate the "
"optimum makeup gain for the other settings.  When pressed you cannot "
"manually adjust the makeup gain however, adjustments to the threshold or "
"ratio will cause the makeup gain to change.\n"
"    A full explanation of the use of these parameters is covered in the user "
"manual.\n"
"    Compressor controls can be \"ganged\" by clicking on the control label "
"in the desired compressor band windows.  When they are ganged moving one "
"control will move all other ganged controls by the same amount.  To ungang "
"just click on the label again.  The labels change to the band color to "
"indicate that they are ganged.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    The graphic EQ (GEQ) can be used to set gain for specific bands of the "
"audio spectrum.  The center of the band is annotated at the bottom of each "
"fader.  Setting a fader in the GEQ will override the HDEQ in the immediate "
"vicinity of the changed fader and cause that curve to be redrawn.  It will "
"not override the parametric notch settings in the HDEQ.  Clicking the right "
"mouse button on a GEQ control will reset the value to 0.0.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    The hand drawn EQ (HDEQ) allows the user to draw the EQ curve using the "
"mouse.  The curve is then splined to fill 1024 EQ bands.  There are a number "
"of other options available in the HDEQ.  There are user defined notches that "
"act as a parametric EQ.  There are also crossover controls that will allow "
"the user to change the compressor crossover points.  The following is a "
"quick guide to using the HDEQ:\n"
"\n"
"    In the background window - left click and release to begin drawing the "
"curve.  Left click again to end the curve.  You can define any portion of "
"the curve, you don't have to define the entire curve.  Drawing can be done "
"from left to right or right to left.  If you try to reverse direction while "
"drawing the data in the reverse direction will be ignored.  You can discard "
"the curve that you are drawing by clicking the middle or right buttons.  "
"Clicking the right mouse button in the HDEQ when not drawing a curve will "
"reset all EQ and notch values to their original (flat) settings.\n"
"\n"
"    Over the crossover bar handles - left click and hold to drag the "
"crossover bars.\n"
"\n"
"    Over the notch handles - left click and hold to drag the notch center or "
"cuttoff frequency and gain.  <Ctrl>-left click will reset the notch to 0.  "
"If you hold the shift key while adjusting the notch handle it will only move "
"in the Y (gain) direction.\n"
"\n"
"    Over the notch width handle - left click and hold to widen or narrow the "
"notches, except the high and low cutoff notches which have no width "
"handles.\n"

msgid ""
"    The input section allows you to set the input gain to the JAMin system.  "
"You can also pan the input left or right.  Clicking the right mouse button "
"on the gain/balance control will reset the value to 0.0/centre.  Clicking "
"the right mouse button on the meters will reset the peak indicator to the "
"current level.\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    The output control allows you to decrease the output level.  The upper "
