"<p>Good DJVU files are separated into foreground and background images. The "
"foreground mostly contains the text. With the render mode you can decide "
"what part of your page will be printed.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Print Full Page:</b> The full page, including foreground and "
"background will be printed, either in color or in grayscale.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Black & White:</b> Foreground and background are printed, but only in "
"black-and-white. If this option is chosen, the files generated will print "
"much faster, but quality will not be as good.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Foreground Only:</b> This option is useful if the background of the "
"page is disturbing and affects the readability of the text.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Background Only:</b> Print only the background of the page.</p>"

"<p>With this dialog you can choose the PostScript language level used by "
"KViewShell. The choice of a language level can dramatically affect printing "
"speed, but has no impact on the quality of the printout.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Level 1:</b> This is the most conservative option, because PostScript "
"Level 1 files can be printed on all printers. The files produced are, "
"however, extremely long, and printing can be very slow.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Level 2:</b> Level 2 PostScript files are much smaller and print much "
"faster than Level 1 files. Level 2 files are supported by almost all "
"printers.</p>\n"
"<p><b>Level 3:</b> Level 3 PostScript files are much smaller and print even "
"faster than Level 2 files. However, Level 3 files are supported only by some "
"modern printers. If Level 3 works for you, this is the best option.</p>"
