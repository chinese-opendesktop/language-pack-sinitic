#. Translators: Text displayed in the bottom bar; second part (and end) of a sentence like "One gsettings operation and 2 dconf operations delayed.", so:
#. * the space before the "and" is probably wanted, if you keeped the "%s%s" translation as-is, and
#. * the "delayed" refers to both the gsettings and dconf operations (at least one of each).
#. Also, "dconf" is a technical term, notably a shell command, so you probably should not translate it.

msgid " and one dconf operation delayed. and %u dconf operations delayed."

#. Translators: Text displayed in the bottom bar. Hacky: I split a sentence like "One gsettings operation and 2 dconf operations delayed." in two parts, before the "and"; there is at least one gsettings operation and one dconf operation. So, you can either keep "%s%s" like that, and have the second part of the translation starting with a space (if that makes sense in your language), or you might use "%s %s" here.
