Because support for the accessibility API is built into the GNOME widgets, your GNOME program should function reasonably well with assistive technologies with no extra work on your part. For example, assistive technologies can automatically read the widget labels that you would normally set in your program anyway (e.g. with GTK function calls such as <function>gtk_label_set_text()</function> or <function>gtk_button_new_with_label()</function>).

msgid "The implementation for the GTK widgets is in a module called GAIL (GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library), which is dynamically loadable at runtime by a GTK application. Once loaded, those parts of your application that use standard GTK widgets will have a basic level of accessibility, without you having to modify your application at all. If GAIL is not loaded, GTK widgets will have a default accessibility implementation that essentially returns no information, though it nominally conforms to the ATK API. Applications which use Bonobo controls, particularly out-of-process ones, also load accessibility support code from module libgail-gnome. Whether or not applications on the GNOME desktop automatically load these accessibility support libraries depends on the value of a <application>gconf</application> key, \"/desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility\"; a boolean value of \"true\" enables support for assistive technologies and applications which call gnome_program_init will automatically load the appropriate accessibility libraries at runtime. \"Pure GTK+ applications\", e.g. those that use gtk+ but do not link to libgnome, rely on the value of the GTK_MODULES environment variable, which must be set to \"gail:atk-bridge\" in order to enable assistive technology support."

msgid "Most assistive technologies running on other desktops have historically found it necessary to maintain a complex off-screen model of the desktop applications, based on snooping of OS events, use of unsupported OS and application features and API, and other highly non-portable techniques. This has made assistive technology support somewhat \"brittle\" and highly OS- and application-specific, even application-version specific. In contrast, on the GNOME Desktop, all the information required by the ATs is provided by the running applications, via the GNOME Accessibility Framework, to a toolkit-independent Service Provider Interface (SPI). The SPI provides a means for UNIX-based ATs, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, to obtain accessibility information from running applications via a consistent, stable API, and can eliminate the need for an off-screen model in many cases. Accessibility support for applications is \"built in\" to application toolkits via toolkit-appropriate APIs (for instance, ATK for most native C applications and the Java Accessibility API for Java apps), and exported to the common \"AT-SPI\" interface via the relevant \"bridge\" (see diagram below)."
