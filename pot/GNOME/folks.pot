#. FIXME: Ideally we’d use a format string translated to the locale of the
#. * persona whose name is being formatted, but no backend provides
#. * information about personas’ locales, so we have to settle for the
#. * current user’s locale.
#. *
#. * We thought about using nl_langinfo(_NL_NAME_NAME_FMT) here, but
#. * decided against it because:
#. *  1. It’s not the best documented API in the world, and its stability
#. *     is in question.
#. *  2. An attempt to improve the interface in glibc met with a wall of
#. *     complaints: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14641.
#. *
#. * However, we do re-use the string format placeholders from
#. * _NL_NAME_NAME_FMT (as documented here:
#. * http://lh.2xlibre.net/values/name_fmt/) because there’s a chance glibc
#. * might eventually grow a useful interface for this.
#. *
#. * It does mean we have to implement our own parser for the name_fmt
#. * format though, since glibc doesn’t provide a formatting function.
#. Translators: This is a format string used to convert structured names
#. * to a single string. It should be translated to the predominant
#. * semi-formal name format for your locale, using the placeholders
#. * documented here: http://lh.2xlibre.net/values/name_fmt/. You may be
#. * able to re-use the existing glibc format string for your locale on that
#. * page if it’s suitable.
#. *
#. * More explicitly: the supported placeholders are %f, %F, %g, %G, %m, %M,
#. * %t. The romanisation modifier (e.g. %Rf) is recognized but ignored.
#. * %s, %S and %d are all replaced by the same thing (the ‘Honorific
#. * Prefixes’ from vCard) so please avoid using more than one.
#. *
#. * For example, the format string ‘%g%t%m%t%f’ expands to ‘John Andrew
#. * Lees’ when used for a persona with first name ‘John’, additional names
#. * ‘Andrew’ and family names ‘Lees’.
#. *
#. * If you need additional placeholders with other information or
#. * punctuation, please file a bug against libfolks:
#. *   https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=folks
