msgid "The word first may be misleading as it only refers to the list of selected items internally provided by the file manager to the plugin. In particular, it has nothing to do with the visual selection you may have done in the file manager window. And, in fact, which is the first selected item in a multiple selection is absolutely undefined and rather unpredictable. Where the action should it be executed ? Your action may be executed in a particular working directory. You may specify it in the Command tab, in the Working directory entry box, or by clicking on Browse to select a folder on the filesystem. Working directory frame Focus on the working directory selection frame. Working directory frame The working directory defaults to %d, which runs the command in the base directory of the (first) selected item. In the particular case of the %d parameter, the first selected item is not very important because it is very likely that all selected items are located in the same base directory. How should the action be executed ? Apart from configuring the conditions, the selection must be met in order your action be displayed in file manager menus, allows you to configure how exactly your command will be executed. Click on the Execution tab to show the page which configures the execution of your command. Configuration of the execution modes Shows how to configure the execution modes of a command. Configuration of the execution modes Execution mode Configuration of the execution mode Focus on the execution mode frame. Configuration of the execution mode The execution mode of your command may be chosen between following values: Normal Starts the command as a standard graphical user interface. Terminal Starts the preferred terminal of the desktop environment, and runs the command in it. Embedded Makes use of a special feature of the file manager which may allow a terminal to be ran in it. As for now, none of the managed file managers implement this feature. Display output Starts the preferred terminal of the desktop environment, and runs the command in it. At end, standard streams (stdout, stderr) are collected and displayed. The execution mode of a command defaults to Normal. That is, the command is executed without any particular pre- or post-work. Startup notification Configuration of the startup modes Focus on the Startup mode frame. Configuration of the startup modes If the execution mode of the command is Normal, and if you know that the application will send a remove message with the DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment variable set, then check the Startup notify checkbox. See the Startup Notification Protocol Specification for more details. Window class If the execution mode of the command is Normal, and if you know that the application will map at least one window with a given class name, then enter that name into the Startup Window Manager class entry box. See the Startup Notification Protocol Specification for more details. Owner of the execution Configuration of the owner of the run Focus on the Execute as frame. Configuration of the owner of the run Enter in the Execute as user entry box the username or the UID of the user your command will be run as. If you do not enter anything in this field, then the command will be executed as the current user. Multiple executions You may want your command to be executed once, providing it the list of selected items as argument. Or you may prefer your command to be repeated for each selected item, providing a different item as argument for each execution. Actually, automatically handles these two behaviors, depending of the form and the order of the parameters in the command arguments. Though some parameters are not depending on the count of the selection (e.g. %c, the selection count itself), most have two declensions: a singular one, e.g. %b, the basename of the selected item; a plural one, e.g. %B, the space-separated list of the basenames of selected items. When the selection is empty or contains only one element, and from this topic point of view, these two forms are exactly equivalent. When the selection contains more than one item: if the first relevant parameter is of a singular form, then will consider that the command is only able to deal with one item at a time, and thus that it has to be ran one time for each selected item; contrarily, if the first relevant parameter found is of the plural form, then will consider that the command is able to deal with a list of items, and thus the command will be executed only once; if all found parameters are irrelevant, then defaults to consider that the command should be executed only once. Characterization of the parameters vs. multiple execution Parameter Description Repetition %b (first) basename singular %B space-separated list of basenames plural %c count of selected items irrelevant %d (first) base directory singular %D space-separated list of base directory of each selected items plural %f (first) filename singular %F space-separated list of selected filenames plural %h hostname of the (first) URI irrelevant %m mimetype of the (first) selected item singular %M space-separated list of the mimetypes of the selected items plural %n username of the (first) URI irrelevant %o no-op operator which forces a singular form of execution singular %O no-op operator which forces a plural form of execution plural %p port number of the (first) URI irrelevant %s scheme of the (first) URI irrelevant %u (first) URI singular %U space-separated list of selected URIs plural %w (first) basename without the extension singular %W space-separated list of basenames without their extension plural %x (first) extension singular %X space-separated list of extensions plural %% the % character irrelevant Usage of singular vs. plural forms Say the current folder is /data, and the current selection contains the three files pierre, paul and jacques. If we have requested echo %b, then the following commands will be successively run: echo pierre echo paul echo jacques This is because %b marks a singular parameter. The command is then run once for each of the selected items. Contrarily, if we have requested echo %B, then the following command will be run: echo pierre paul jacques This is because %B marks a plural parameter. The command is then run only once, with the list of selected items as arguments. If we have requested echo %b %B, then the following commands will be successively run: echo pierre pierre paul jacques echo paul pierre paul jacques echo jacques pierre paul jacques This is because the first relevant parameter is %b, and so the command is run once for each selected item, replacing at each occurrence the %b parameter with the corresponding item. The second parameter is computed and added as arguments to the executed command. And if we have requested echo %B %b, then the following commands will be run: echo pierre paul jacques pierre This is because the first relevant parameter here is %B. The command is then run only once, replacing %B with the space-separated list of basenames. As the command is only run once, the %b is substituted only once with the (first) basename."

msgid "Each time the selection or the location change in the file manager, checks all your actions, comparing the defined conditions against the new location and selection: all defined conditions must be satisfied in order your action be actually displayed. For now, all managed file managers have removed this API from their extension library. The toolbar is still configurable in , but is will not be honored by any of the targeted file managers. Basename-based conditions You may decide that your action will appear depending on the basenames of the items currently selected in the file-manager: you may define that each item of the selection must meet some sort of basename, and you may simultaneously decide that none of the selected item(s) can have some other sort of basename. Click on the Basenames tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your basename-based conditions. Basename-based conditions Shows the tab which lets you define basename-based conditions. The basename-based conditions tab In fact, basename-based conditions are built as a list of and patterns. In order for your action to be a candidate regarding these basename-based conditions, each element of the selection must be valid for all the listed conditions: the basename of each element must match at least one of the defined patterns, and must not match any of the defined patterns. If at least one element of the selection does not match all the defined conditions, then your action will not be displayed. When targeting the selection context menu, your basename-based conditions will be checked against the currently selected items. When targeting the location context menu or the toolbar, your basename-based conditions will be checked against the basename of the current location. Defining a new basename-based condition involves two steps. Define the new condition filter. Press Insert or click on button to insert a new condition filter Edit the newly inserted condition filter to the basename you want match. A basename-based condition may use or wildcard characters. Indicates whether this a or a condition. Click on the Must match one of or Must not match any of radio button in the same row to set the corresponding condition. Depending of your target operating system, make sure that the Match case checkbox is activated (or not). When activated, all filters are considered as case sensitive, which means that /my/file filename is considered distinct from /My/File one. This is the default behavior on Unix-like systems. When deactivated, filters are considered as case insensitive, which means that /my/file and /My/File filenames are considered the same name. This is most probably what you want if you target some sort of system. Removing a defined basename-based condition is as simple as selecting it, and pressing Del (or clicking on button). By default, the basename-based condition is just one must match one of * condition. As all basenames always match the condition, this just means that basename-based conditions are not considered as relevant for the action. Mimetype-based conditions You may decide that your action will appear depending on the mimetypes of the items currently selected in the file-manager: you may define that each item of the selection must meet some sort of mimetype; and you may simultaneously decide that none of the selected item(s) can have some other sort of mimetype. Click on the Mimetypes tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your mimetype-based conditions. Mimetype-based conditions Shows the tab which lets you define mimetype-based conditions. The mimetype-based conditions tab In fact, mimetype-based conditions are built as a list of and patterns. In order for your action to be a candidate regarding these mimetype-based conditions, each element of the selection must be valid for all the listed conditions: the mimetype of each element must match at least one of the defined patterns, and must not match any of the defined patterns. If at least one element of the selection does not match all the defined conditions, then your action will not be displayed. When targeting the selection context menu, your mimetype-based conditions will be checked against the currently selected items. When targeting the location context menu or the toolbar, your mimetype-based conditions will be checked against the mimetype of the current location, which happens to be the well known inode/directory mimetype. Defining a new mimetype-based condition involves two steps. Define the new condition filter. Press Insert or click on button to insert a new condition filter Edit the newly inserted condition filter to the mimetype you want match. A mimetype must be defined as a group/subgroup expression. The wildcard is supported only in some situations: The */* expression matches all mimetypes. As a convenient shortcut, the literal is also accepted for this same purpose. A group/* string matches all subgroups of group mimetype. The */subgroup string is not accepted as a valid wildcard. Indicates whether this a or a condition. Click on the Must match one of or Must not match any of radio button in the same row to set the corresponding condition. Removing a defined mimetype-based condition is as simple as selecting it, and pressing Del (or clicking on button). By default, the mimetype-based condition is just one must match one of */* condition. As all mimetypes always match the */*, this just means that mimetypes are not considered as relevant for the action. Example of usual mimetypes all/all Matches all items. all/allfiles Matches all regular files. inode/directory Matches only directories. Folder-based conditions You may decide that your action will appear depending on the directory the items currently selected in the file-manager are located in: you may define that each item of the selection must be located in one hierarchy or in another; and you may simultaneously decide that none of the selected item(s) can be located in some other hierarchy. A folder-based condition must be understood as the specification of the hierarchy in which the currently examined item should (or should not) stay: this is a pattern on the dirname of the element. Click on the Folders tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your folder-based conditions. Folder-based conditions Shows the tab which lets you define folder-based conditions. The folder-based conditions tab In fact, folder-based conditions are built as a list of and patterns. In order for your action to be a candidate regarding these folder-based conditions, each element of the selection must be valid for all the listed conditions: each element must be located in one of the defined folders, and must not match any of the defined folders. If at least one element of the selection does not match all the defined conditions, then your action will not be displayed. When targeting the selection context menu, your folder-based conditions will be checked against the dirname of each currently selected items. When targeting the location context menu or the toolbar, your folder-based conditions will be checked against the current location. Defining a new folder-based condition involves two steps. Define the new condition filter. Press Insert or click on button to insert a new condition filter Edit the newly inserted condition filter to the folder you want match. The and characters are accepted as wildcards at any level of the defined folder filter. Or click on Browse to select a folder on the file system. Indicates whether this a or a condition. Click on the Must match one of or Must not match any of radio button in the same row to set the corresponding condition. Removing a defined folder-based condition is as simple as selecting it, and pressing Del (or clicking on button). By default, the folder-based condition is just one must match one of / condition. As / is always the top of an Unix-like file system, then all selected items always match this condition. If you target a system, then this default value may not be what you actually want. Scheme-base-conditions You may decide that your action will appear depending on the schemes of the URIs of the items currently selected in the file-manager: you may define that each item of the selection must have some scheme; and you may simultaneously decide that none of the selected item(s) may have some other scheme. Click on the Schemes tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your scheme-based conditions. Scheme-based conditions Shows the tab which lets you define scheme-based conditions. The scheme-based conditions tab In fact, scheme-based conditions are built as a list of and patterns. In order for your action to be a candidate regarding these scheme-based conditions, each element of the selection must be valid for all the listed conditions: the scheme of each element must match at least one of the defined patterns, and must not match any of the defined patterns. If at least one element of the selection does not match all the defined conditions, then your action will not be displayed. When targeting the selection context menu, your scheme-based conditions will be checked against the currently selected items. When targeting the location context menu or the toolbar, your scheme-based conditions will be checked against the scheme of the current location. Defining a new scheme-based condition involves two steps. Define the new condition filter. Press Insert or click on button to insert a new condition filter Edit the newly inserted condition filter to the scheme you want match. Scheme-based conditions only accept wildcard, which stands for any scheme. Or click on Common to select a scheme among those predefined in Edit Preferences . Selecting a scheme among predefined defaults Show the list of predefined schemes. Selecting a scheme among predefined defaults A new scheme may only be selected here if it is not already defined as a scheme filter. To select a new scheme, click OK, or double-click on the desired row. Indicates whether this a or a condition. Click on the Must match one of or Must not match any of radio button in the same row to set the corresponding condition. Removing a defined scheme-based condition is as simple as selecting it, and pressing Del (or clicking on button). By default, the scheme-based condition is just one must match one of * condition, which means that schemes are not relevant for this action. Capability-based conditions Capabilities are some properties that a file may exhibit to the user. But except for the Local capability, all others depend on the user who executes the command. You may so decide that your action will appear, or not, depending on the capabilities of the selected item(s) vs. the current user. Click on the Capabilities tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your capability-based conditions. Capability-based conditions Shows the tab which lets you define capability-based conditions. The capability-based conditions tab In fact, capability-based conditions are built as a list of must match all of and patterns. In order for your action to be a candidate regarding these capability-based conditions, each element of the selection must be valid for all the listed conditions: the capability of each element must match each of the defined must match all of capabilities, and must not match any of the defined ones. If at least one element of the selection does not match all the defined conditions, then your action will not be displayed. When targeting the selection context menu, your capability-based conditions will be checked against the currently selected items. When targeting the location context menu or the toolbar, your capability-based conditions will be checked against those of the current location. Defining a new capability-based condition involves two steps. Define the new condition filter. Press Insert to insert a new condition filter. Edit the newly inserted condition filter to the capability you want match. Or click on to open the Adding a new capability dialog box. Managed capabilities Shows the list of managed capabilities. The list of managed capabilities A new capability may only be selected here if it is not already defined as a capability filter. To select a new capability, click OK, or double-click on the desired row. Indicates whether this a must match all of or a condition. Click on the Must match all of or Must not match any of radio button in the same row to set the corresponding condition. Removing a defined capability-based condition is as simple as selecting it, and pressing Del (or clicking on button). By default, the capability-based condition list is empty. This means that capabilities are not relevant for this action. Selection count condition You may define that your action will only appear if the current selection in the file manager has some precise count, or some precise relation with a given count. A selection count use case If your action consists in displaying the differences between two files, you may define here Count = (equal to) 2. Click on the Environment tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your environment-based conditions. Environment-based conditions Shows the tab which lets you define environment-based conditions. This includes the selection count configuration, the desktop selection, along with the runtime filters. The environment-based conditions tab The selection count condition is defined in the Appears if selection contains frame. Selection count condition frame Focus on the Appears if selection contains frame. Selection count condition frame When targeting the selection context menu, the count condition defined here will be checked against the count of currently selected items. When targeting the location context menu or the toolbar, the count condition will be checked against zero because there is no selected item in this case. To define a selection count condition: Select in the Count drop-down list the operator you want apply to the selection count: (strictly less than) = (equal to) (strictly greater than) Enter the reference count you wish. The selection count defaults to Count &gt; (strictly greater than) 0, which means that the action will be a candidate to be displayed as soon as at least one item is selected in the file manager. Desktop selection You may define that your action: will always appear, or will only appear in some given desktop environments, or will not appear in some given desktop environments. Only one choice between these three items is possible. Click on the Environment tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your environment-based conditions. The desktop selection is defined in the Desktop environment frame. Desktop selection frame Focus on the Desktop environment frame. Desktop selection frame To define the desktop environment condition: First select the type of filter: should your action always appear, regardless of the desktop environment ? should your action only appear in some desktop environment(s) ? should your action never appear in some desktop environment(s) ? If your action should not always appear, then select the relevant desktop environment(s) in the listbox in the right side. The targeted desktop environment condition defaults to Always appear, which means that the action will be a candidate to be displayed regardless of the current desktop environment. Executable found condition You may define that your action will only appear if some prerequisite package is installed on your system. This is checked here by specifying that a specific file, known or at least supposed to be provided by the package, must be present on the file system, and executable. Click on the Environment tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your environment-based conditions. The executable found condition is defined in the Execution environment frame. Execution environment frame Focus on the Execution environment frame. Execution environment frame To define the relevant file, enter its full filename in the Appears if the file is executable entry box, or click on Browse to select a file on the file system. Leave the field empty if this condition is not relevant for your action. You may embed some parameters in the searched filename. These parameters will be dynamically substituted at runtime with values which will depend on currently selected item(s). D-Bus registration condition You may define that your action will only appear if some given name is registered on the D-Bus system at runtime. Click on the Environment tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your environment-based conditions, and focus on Execution environment frame. To define the relevant name, enter it in the Appears if the name is registered on D-Bus entry box. Leave the field empty if this condition is not relevant for your action. You may embed some parameters in the searched name. These parameters will be dynamically substituted at runtime with values which will depend on currently selected item(s). Customized condition You may define that your action will only appear if some given command outputs a true string on its standard output. Click on the Environment tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your environment-based conditions, and focus on Execution environment frame. This lets you define your own customized condition filter, by writing a small script which outputs, or not, the true string on stdout when it is ran. To define the command, enter it in the Appears if the command outputs \"true\" entry box. Leave the field empty if this condition is not relevant for your action. You may embed some parameters in the executed filename or its options. These parameters will be dynamically substituted at runtime with values which will depend on currently selected item(s). Running process condition You may define that your action will only appear if some given binary is currently running. Click on the Environment tab to show the page which will permit you to configure your environment-based conditions, and focus on Execution environment frame. To define the binary, enter its name in the Appears if the binary is running entry box, or click on Browse to select a file on the file system. Even if you enter here the full filename of a binary, only its basename will be searched for in the processes list at runtime. Leave the field empty if this condition is not relevant for your action. You may embed some parameters in the searched name. These parameters will be dynamically substituted at runtime with values which will depend on currently selected item(s)."
