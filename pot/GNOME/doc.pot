In a typical mud, players can communicate and fight each other, use magic, trade, travel to new zones, resolve quizzes (also called quests), and become part of communities like guilds, orders, etc. The environment also varies between MUDs, but the most common are ambiented in fantasy worlds, similar to those described by Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings' or Dungeons and Dragons. Classic MUDs are text-based, and can be accessed through a simple `telnet' connection; the user inputs orders to the MUD server, and the server replies with the result of the action."
