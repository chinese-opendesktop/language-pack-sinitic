"A solitaire version of the classic Eastern tile game. Tiles are stacked on "
"the board at the start of the game. The goal is to remove all the tiles in "
"as little time as possible. Select two matching tiles and they will "
"disappear from the board, but you can only select a tile if there is an "
"empty space to its left or right at the same level. Be careful: tiles that "
"look alike may actually be slightly different."
