In November 2000, SIP was accepted as a 3GPP signaling protocol and permanent element of the IMS architecture. It is one of the leading signalling protocols for Voice over IP."

msgid "H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the growing needs of VoIP networks. One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards, not only defining the basic call model, but in addition the supplementary services, needed to address business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks. H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking scenarios between IP and ISDN, respectively between IP and QSIG. A call model, similar to the ISDN call model, eases the introduction of IP Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems."
