msgid "The spacetime use of gdk_pixbuf_new is now a thin band that only spikes briefly (it is now the sixteenth band down and shaded magenta). As a bonus, the peak memory use has dropped by 200 kB since the spike occurs before other memory is allocated. If two processes like this were run together the chances of the peak memory usage coinciding, and hence the risk of swapping, would be quite low."

msgid "We now face diminishing returns for our optimization efforts. The graph hints at another possible approach: Both the \"other\" and \"heap admin\" bands are quite large. This tells us that there are a lot of small allocations being made from a variety of places. Eliminating these will be difficult, but if they can be grouped then the individual allocations can be larger and the \"heap admin\" overhead can be reduced."

msgid "Secondly, <app>Massif</app> only takes into account the memory used by your own program. Resources like pixmaps are stored in the X server and aren't considered by <app>Massif</app>. In the <app>Swell Foop</app> example we have actually only moved the memory consumption from client-side pixbufs to server-side pixmaps. Even though we cheated there are performance gains. Keeping the image data in the X server makes the graphics routines quicker and removes a lot of inter-process communication. Also, the pixmaps will be stored in a native graphics format which is often more compact than the 32-bit RGBA format used by gdk_pixbuf. To measure the effect of pixmaps, and other X resources use the <link href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/xrestop\">xrestop</link> program."
