#. Orca doesn't know what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca
#. treats key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats

#. situation and switch automatically. This string is a label for a GUI option to

#. and subsequent presses of Down Arrow would be controlled by the web browser

#. Translators: Orca has a setting through which users can control how a number is
#. spoken. The options are digits ("1 2 3") and words ("one hundred and twenty
#. three"). There is an associated Orca command for quickly toggling between the
#. two options. This string to be translated is the brief message spoken when the
#. user has enabled speaking numbers as words.

#. Translators: this is the spoken word for the character 'x' (U+2717)
#. This symbol is included here because it can be used as a bullet in
#. an OOo list.  The goal is to inform the user of the appearance of
#. the bullet, while making it clear that it is a bullet and not simply
#. the typed letter 'x'.  "Ballot x" might confuse the user.  Hence the
#. use of "x-shaped bullet".
