It is the simplest possible computing device which can only perform very simple operations. However, it can be shown that Turing machine is every bit as powerful as any of the modern programming languages: every algorithm that can be implemented in, say, Java, can also be written as a program for the Turing Machine. Of course, no one uses the Turing machine for actual computing work, but it is very useful in theoretical computer science and mathematical logic, not to mention that it is a nice toy to play with."
