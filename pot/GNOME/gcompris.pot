"At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players "
"take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six "
"houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this "
"house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise "
"from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not "
"distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That "
"is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is "
"skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if "
"the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to "
"two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the "
"player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If "
"the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's "
"house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a "
"move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and "
"the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the "
"opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an "
"opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a "
"move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses "
"are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent "
"seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in "
"his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia &lt;http://en."

"The multiples of a number are all the numbers that are equal to the original "
"number times another number. For example, 24, 36, 48 and 60 are all "
"multiples of 12. 25 is not a multiple of 12 because there isn't any number "
"that can be multiplied by 12 to get 25. If one number is a factor of a "
"second number, then the second number is a multiple of the first number. "
"Again, you can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people "
"who belong to those families. The factor 5, has parents 10, grandparents 15, "
"great-grandparents 20, great-great-grandparents 25, and every extra step of "
"5 is another great- in front! But the number 5 does not belong in the 8 or "
"23 families. You can't fit any number of 5s into 8 or 23 with nothing left "
"over. So '8 isn't a multiple of 5, nor is 23. Only 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ... are "
"multiples (or families or steps) of 5. Use the arrow keys to navigate around "
