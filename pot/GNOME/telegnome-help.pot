msgid "Every page can have subpages, that is: the page consists of a couple of subpages. This way the numbering of pages can stay the same, but the amount of information in a page can vary. For example: the page that serves the news (101 on Dutch TV) can have just a few items of information (nothing happened in the world), and thus have no subpages, or it can have a lot of items, spread out on subpages. These subpages are usually automatically updated on your TV, timed by an interval in which the page can be read. This means that if you want to see subpage 7 and the current displayed subpage is 3, you'll have to wait some time. This can be very annoying. Also, if the timing is to fast, the page may have disappeared before you've read it, which means that you'll have to wait for the page to come up again."
